# Artificial Intelligence Project B

## Overview

This repository includes a game playing agent that uses a minimax and alpha-beta pruning to play the game Freckers. 

The agent plays the game at a high level, and is able to beat a human player. Freckers is a game similar to checkers, but with with frogs that can chain-jump over other frogs. The goal is to try and get to the other side of the board. Freckers is a checkers-like game that uses frogs that can chain-jump.

Also included is a detailed report that explains the purpose of the project and the considerations made to reach the final agent that we did.
